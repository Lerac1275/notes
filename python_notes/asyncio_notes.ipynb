    "A primer on how to use asynchronous programming in python via the inbuilt `asyncio` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that asynchrnous programming __is not__ the same as multithreading. The latter refers to creating multiple threads to _run several processes concurrently_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming only performs __one process at a time__, however when a certain task is paused (awaiting a response / sleeping / etc), the processor can be given to another task so as to minimize the overall compute time required. \n",

    "##  A note on running `async` in jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have a persistent `asyncio` [loop running](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/autoawait.html#difference-between-terminal-ipython-and-ipykernel). This means that you will not be able to execute asyncronous code in notebook cells using `asyncio.run()`. You may simply call `await function()` instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as there being a `asyncio.run()` command inherent to each executed cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the examples listed here will be with respect to asynchronous programming in genenral python environments, not in jupyter."
